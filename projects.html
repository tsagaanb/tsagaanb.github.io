            <h2>Pantry Wizard</h2>
            <p>A web application that retrieves ingredients as
                an input from the user, uses the Spoonacular API to fetch recipes
                that includes those ingredients and return it back to the user, 
                which the user can save them to view later. We also added a tool
                to return food related news to the user using the NEWS API. The 
                search bar has the word "Food" on default and returns food news. 
                The user can also change the word on the search bar and retrieve 
                news related to anything.<br>

            <h2>Ink & Impressions</h2>
            <p>A web application that is used to track book progresses and write reviews,
                simialar to GoodReads. But the difference is that you can't view everyone's 
                reviews on progresses, only those of your friend's. I uploaded around 15,000 
                books to my database using Google Book API. The app has functions like
                sending/accepting/rejecting friend requests, writing book reviews, adding a 
                book to a read/want to read/currently reading shelves, and viewing what your
                friends shelved and see the reviews they wrote for a book.  <br>
